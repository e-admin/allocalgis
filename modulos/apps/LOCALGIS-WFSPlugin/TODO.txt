## Further Ideas for this WFSPlugin
##
 
 - make (poorly configured) UMN MapServer-WFS also available
 - integrate WFS-T against geoserver/deegree
 - more general SRS-integration (in deegree)
 - create user-documentation
 - replace the MaxFeature-selector to a more appropriate place (dunno
   where yet).
 - Make casting of doubles not as integers (Problem resides in geoserver
   and deegree)
