    MICROSOFT FOUNDATION CLASS LIBRARY : jecwppc Project Overview
========================================================================


AppWizard has created this jecwppc DLL for you.  This DLL not only
demonstrates the basics of using the Microsoft Foundation classes but
is also a starting point for writing your DLL.

This file contains a summary of what you will find in each of the files that
make up your jecwppc DLL.

jecwppc.vcproj
    This is the main project file for VC++ projects generated using an Application Wizard. 
    It contains information about the version of Visual C++ that generated the file, and 
    information about the platforms, configurations, and project features selected with the
    Application Wizard.

jecwppc.h
    This is the main header file for the DLL.  It declares the
    CjecwppcApp class.

jecwppc.cpp
    This is the main DLL source file.  It contains the class CjecwppcApp.


jecwppcppc.rc
    This is a listing of all of the Microsoft Windows resources that the
    project uses when compiling for the Pocket PC platform, or a platform 
    that supports the same user interface model.  It includes the icons, 
    bitmaps, and cursors that are stored in the RES subdirectory. When the
    .rc file is persisted, the defines in the data section are persisted
    as the hexadecimal version of the numeric value they are defined to 
    rather than the friendly name of the define.



res\jecwppc.rc2
    This file contains resources that are not edited by Microsoft 
    Visual C++.  You should place all resources not editable by
    the resource editor in this file.

jecwppc.def
    This file contains information about the DLL that must be
    provided to run with Microsoft Windows.  It defines parameters
    such as the name and description of the DLL.  It also exports
    functions from the DLL.

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Other standard files:

StdAfx.h, StdAfx.cpp
    These files are used to build a precompiled header (PCH) file
    named jecwppc.pch and a precompiled types file named StdAfx.obj.


resourceppc.h
    This is the standard header file, which defines new resource IDs.
    Microsoft Visual C++ reads and updates this file.
